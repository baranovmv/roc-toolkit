 *
 * A peer (sender or receiver) may have multiple slots, which may be independently
 * bound or connected. You can use multiple slots on sender to connect it to multiple
 * receiver addresses, or you can use multiple slots on receiver to bind it to
 * multiple receiver addresses.
 *
 * Inside each slot, there can be up to one endpoint for each interface type, for
 * example one source endpoint, one control endpoint, and so on. See \ref roc_interface
 * for more details.
 *
 * Slots are created implicitly. Just specify slot index when binding or connecting
 * endpoint, and slot will be automatically created if it doesn't exist yet.
 * Slot indices can be arbitrary numbers and does not need to be continuous.
 *
 * In simple cases, when one slot is enough, just use \c ROC_SLOT_DEFAULT,
 * which is an alias for slot index zero.

/** Network interface.
 *
 * Interface is a way to access the peer (sender or receiver) via network.
 *
 * Each slot of a peer (see \ref roc_slot) has multiple interfaces, one for each of the
 * interface types. The user interconnects peers by binding an interface of one peer to
 * an URI, and then connecting the corresponding interface of another peer to that URI.
 *
 * A URI is represented by \ref roc_endpoint object.
 *
 * The interface defines the type of the communication with the remote peer and the
 * set of protocols (URI schemes) that can be used with this particular interface.
 *
 * \c ROC_INTERFACE_CONSOLIDATED is an interface for high-level protocols which
 * automatically manage all necessary communication: transport streams, control messages,
 * parameter negotiation, etc. When a consolidated connection is established, peers may
 * automatically setup lower-level interfaces like \c ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_SOURCE, \c
 * ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_REPAIR, and \c ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_CONTROL.
 *
 * \c ROC_INTERFACE_CONSOLIDATED is mutually exclusive with lower-level interfaces.
 * In most cases, the user needs only \c ROC_INTERFACE_CONSOLIDATED. However, the
 * lower-level interfaces may be useful if an external signaling mechanism is used or for
 * compatibility with third-party software.
 *
 * \c ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_SOURCE and \c ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_REPAIR are lower-level
 * unidirectional transport-only interfaces. The first is used to transmit audio stream,
 * and the second is used to transmit redundant repair stream, if FEC is enabled.
 *
 * \c ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_CONTROL is a lower-level bidirectional interface for control
 * streams. If you use \c ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_SOURCE and \c ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_REPAIR,
 * you usually also need to use \c ROC_INTERFACE_AUDIO_CONTROL to enable carrying
 * additional non-transport information.
